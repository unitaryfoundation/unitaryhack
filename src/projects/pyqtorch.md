**[`pyqtorch`](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch)** is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based state vector simulator designed for quantum machine learning.
It acts as the main backend for [`Qadence`](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence), a digital-analog quantum programming interface.
**[`pyqtorch`](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch)** allows for writing fully differentiable quantum programs using both digital and analog operations; enabled via a intuitive, torch-based syntax.

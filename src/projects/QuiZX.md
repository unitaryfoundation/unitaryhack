PyZX is a Python library for quantum circuit optimisation and compiling using the ZX-calculus. It's great for hacking, learning, and trying things out in Jupyter notebooks. However, it's written to maximise clarity and fun, not performance. This is a port of some of the core functionality of PyZX to the Rust programming language. This is a modern systems programming language, which enables writing software that is very fast and memory efficient. One of the main reasons QuiZX was developed was to perform strong classical simulation of quantum circuits using the ZX calculus. For large circuits, this is extremely hardware-intensive, so it requires high performance techniques.

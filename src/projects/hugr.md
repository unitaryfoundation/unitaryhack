The Hierarchical Unified Graph Representation (HUGR, pronounced _hugger_) is a common representation for hybrid quantum circuits and operations, used at the backbone of 🐠 Guppy.

The project is focused on providing a fast and extensible framework for optimizing the next generation of quantum programs, that mix quantum circuits with classical control flow in the same package.
